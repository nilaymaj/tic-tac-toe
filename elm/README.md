# Tic-Tac-Toe in Elm

To run the app, you need to have Elm installed.
Run `elm make --output game.js src/Main.elm` to create the output JS
Then open `index.html` in your browser to play.

- `index.html` is the root file to open the app.
- `src/Main.elm` is the root Elm file for the app, which is compiled to `game.js`.
- `tests/MainTest.elm` contains loosely written tests for some of the functions.
