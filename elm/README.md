# Tic-Tac-Toe in Elm

- `index.html` is the root file to open the app.
- `game.js` is just the Elm code compiled to JS for usage in the app.
- `src/Main.elm` is the root Elm file for the app, which is compiled to `game.js`.

To compile the Elm code into JS, run `elm make --output game.js src/Main.elm`.
